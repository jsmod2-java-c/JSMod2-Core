> About JSmod2

JSmod2 needs the following dependencies:

* [JSmod2 Protocol](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/Jsmod2_protocol.git)

* [Smod2](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2)

`JSmod2` is a java extension server 
developed based on `Smod2` and [ProxyHandler](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/ProxyHandler)

The role of JSmod2 is to extend the language of SCPSL
so that Java can also develop SCPSL plugins.

Also, `JSmod2` is a Java server 
development framework, by the time it provides a lot of `APIs`,
everyone can use `JSmod2` to develop plugins.

`JSmod2` needs `Smod2`, and you need to install `ProxyHandler` 
correctly(Grab it into \sm_plugins). In the future, `JSmod2` will support 
connecting multiple `Smod2` servers to form a central cluster.

Welcome everyone to join us, 
currently `JSmod2` is still in the development stage, 
Founder [@MagicLu550](https://github.com/MagicLu550) hopes everyone can contribute
by sending issues ,Prs and suggestions.

If you want to participate in the development of JSmod2,
you can refer to [JSmod2-design](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/jsmod2-design) for further information.

> How to start?
* We recommended you to set up in Windows Server 2008-2016 / Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 LTS

* [Environment](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [ProxyHandler](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/JSMod2-ProxyHandler)

After finished installing JRE, you need to put ProxyHandler.dll into 
(Where your server is)\sm_plugins, then start LocalAdmin.exe / MultiAdmin.exe.
If there's no problem, launch JSmod2.jar:
`java -jar jsmod2.jar`

> How to develop a plugin?

1. First you need to create a plugin.yml
```yaml

name: pluginName
main: Package.MainClass
description: Description of the plugin.
version: The version of the plugin.

```
2. Create JSmod2 main class, and the main class you had been set in plugin.yml:
```java
package Package;
/**
* This is the main class
*/
public class MainClass extends PluginBase{
    
        public void onLoad(){
            //The server is officially started before it can be registered.
        }
    
        public void onEnable(){
            //The contents of the server startup, can be registered, initialized, etc.
    
        }
    
        public void onDisable(){
            //Running content when the server is shut down
        }
} 

```
3. Create a Listener:
```java
package Package;

public class TestListener implements Listener{
    //EventManager has a listener priority, see the note
    @EventManager
    public void JoinEvent(PlayerJoinEvent e){
        //Trigger corresponding event will run
    }
    
}
```
4. Create a Command:
```java
package Package;

public class TestCommand extends Command{
    
   
    public TestCommand(Plugin plugin){
        super("test","CONSOLE", "hello,jsmod2",plugin);
    }
    //override the method
    public boolean execute(CommandSender commandSender, String[] args){
        //Processing when executing instructions
    }
}

```
5. Register the Command and Listener:
```java
package Package;
/**
* This is the main class
*/
public class MainClass extends PluginBase{
    
        public void onLoad(){
            //The server is officially started before it can be registered.
        }
    
        public void onEnable(){
            //The contents of the server startup, can be registered, initialized, etc.
            this.getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new TestListener(),this);
            this.getServer().getPluginManager().registerCommand(new TestCommand(this));
        }
    
        public void onDisable(){
            //Running content when the server is shut down
        }
} 

```
6. New API can register the Listeners and Commands of JSmod2'sï¼›

```java
package Package;


@Main(name="exmaple")

@EnableRegister
public class Main extends PluginBase{
    public void onLoad(){
    }
    public void onEnable(){
    }
    public void onDisable(){
    }
}
```
